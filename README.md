A SQL fingerprinter.

sql-fingerprint reduces SQL queries to recognizable fingerprints for easier comparison.
The goal is to provide readable traces from queries captured during tests, so that changes can be tracked over time.

For example, given a query like:

```sql
SELECT name, age /* computed */ FROM cheeses WHERE origin = 'France'
```

â€¦it will output a fingerprint like:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM cheeses WHERE ...
```
